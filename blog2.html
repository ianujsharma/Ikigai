  <h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses">Strengths and Weaknesses of Tata Steel and JSW Steel</h2>
  
  <h3>Revenue and Growth</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tata Steel:</b> Tata Steel posted a big revenue growth, reaching ₹140,987 Cr in FY24, showing a solid recovery after the pandemic.</li>
    <li><b>JSW Steel:</b> JSW Steel also had revenue of ₹133,609 Cr in FY24, indicating steady growth and strategic diversification.</li>
    <li><b>Comparison:</b> Tata Steel leads in revenue, mainly because of its larger scale, but JSW Steel's consistent growth shows it has a strong and resilient business model.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="blog-divider">

  <h3>Profitability</h3>
  <p>Revenue growth is great, but profitability is where the real story is. A company could have strong revenue, but if it can’t turn that into profit, it might face trouble in the long run.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tata Steel:</b> Tata Steel’s operating profit margin hit 25% in FY22 but dropped to just 3% in FY24, despite revenue nearly doubling in the years since. Net profit dropped sharply from ₹15,495.1 Cr in FY23 to ₹4,807.4 Cr in FY24.</li>
    <li><b>JSW Steel:</b> JSW Steel had some ups and downs with profitability. Operating profits of ₹12,196 Cr in FY21 grew to ₹12,102 Cr in FY24, but there was a dip to ₹6,968 Cr in FY23 before rebounding in FY24.</li>
    <li><b>Comparison:</b> Tata Steel saw some wild swings in profitability, and the huge drop in FY24 is a red flag. On the other hand, JSW Steel has been more consistent, which is an important factor when thinking about long-term stability.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="blog-divider">

  <h3>Financial Stability</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tata Steel:</b> Tata Steel managed to lower its debt-to-equity ratio to 1.29 in FY24, showing improvement in debt management. However, fluctuations over the years indicate inconsistency.</li>
    <li><b>JSW Steel:</b> JSW Steel reduced its debt-to-equity ratio steadily from 1.84 in FY21 to 1.46 in FY24, but its interest coverage ratio dropped to 0.99 in FY24, signaling potential future challenges.</li>
    <li><b>Comparison:</b> Tata Steel’s debt reduction is impressive, but consistency is lacking. JSW Steel has been steadier in reducing debt but faces risks due to low interest coverage.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="blog-divider">

  <h3>Cash Flow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tata Steel:</b> Tata Steel saw a remarkable increase in cash flow, growing over 200% in FY24 to ₹27,328 Cr.</li>
    <li><b>JSW Steel:</b> JSW Steel faced a significant cash flow drop to ₹5,449 Cr in FY24, indicating operational challenges.</li>
    <li><b>Comparison:</b> Tata Steel's strong cash flow reflects operational efficiency, while JSW Steel's decline highlights areas for improvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="blog-divider">

  <h3>Overview of Financial Files</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Both companies have shown steady revenue growth.</li>
    <li>Tata Steel leads in cash flow and debt management, but profitability is inconsistent.</li>
    <li>JSW Steel maintains stable profitability and EPS with consistent debt management.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="blog-divider">

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Tata Steel stands out with its large revenue base, strong cash flow, and good debt management, but it needs to address the recent drop in profitability. JSW Steel, though smaller in revenue, has been more stable with profitability and debt management. Both are key players in India’s steel industry, each with unique strengths, making them solid candidates for long-term growth potential.</p>
